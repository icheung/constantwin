  As a user
  I want to be able to delete a task from my list
  So that I can remove tasks I donâ€™t want from the list

  Background:

    #Given I am logged in as "sample@email.com"
    Given I am logged in as "foo" with password "foopassword"
    And I am on the dashboard
    And I follow "New task"
    And I fill in "Description" with "Do laundry"
    And I press "Create"

    Given a user "foo" exists with email "foo@foo.com" and password "foopassword"
    And I am on the login page
    When I fill in "foo" for "Login"
    And I fill in "foopassword" for "Password"
    And I press "Log in"
