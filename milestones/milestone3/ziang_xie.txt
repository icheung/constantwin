Although the app overall impressed with with its clean implemention and its
adherence to the rule that the features of deployed applications be functional,
one feature which was particularly impressive was the account management.
I found the code for this within "/app/views/devise/registrations/edit.html.erb".
A seemingly custom-defined "person" model for authentication was very well
fleshed out. They seem to have used a flexible authentication system called "devise",
which allowed them to make the user system more modular, and passed in the
vehicles of a particular user within a resources object. Routes were all named
rather than specifying controller and action or hard-coding path.
One possible improvement is more use of the controllers, which have surprisingly
little code. Overall there is a very good use of partials and good modularity as well.
