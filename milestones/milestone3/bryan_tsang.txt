Feature:
  Really, really awesome cool drawing canvas application!  You can use
  your paintbrushes to draw anything you want on the screen.
  
  The code that makes the magic is a bit complicated.  It's a bunch of
  Javascript functions:
    - init()
    - clickTool()
    - findElements()
    - injectCanvas()
    - registerTools()
    - registerChat()
    - toolWidth()
    - toolColor()
    - toolEraser()
    - canvasCoords()
    - mouseDown()
    - mouseUp()
    - mouseMove()
    - scheduleSave()
    - save()
    - schedulePoll()
    - poll()
    - sendChat()
    - publish()
    - compose()
  
  Seems like the actual drawing magic is done using tons of AJAX and
  HTML5.
  
  Overall, it's pretty awesome.  All the functions are clearly separated
  and generally easy to read.  But I have to admit that it's quite a
  bit of work.  Major props to these guys for making an awesome
  whiteboard app!
